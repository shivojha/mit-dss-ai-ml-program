Python Experience:
The percentage of success depends on how well you manage your learning in the program; success rate will be 100%. 
Python is foundational to success in Machine Learning, not just for syntax but for its role in data manipulation, model building, and analysis.Why Python is Crucial in ML: 
1. Data Preparation & Manipulation – Cleaning and transforming data using Pandas & NumPy.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing trends with Matplotlib & Seaborn.
3. Model Building & Optimization – Implementing algorithms with Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, & PyTorch.
4. Automation & Scaling – Deploying models and integrating with cloud platforms.While data manipulation is key, Python supports the entire ML pipeline. Mastering it enhances your ability to apply ML concepts effectively. Let us know if you’d like additional resources to strengthen your skills!
